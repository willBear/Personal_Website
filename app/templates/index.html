            <div>
                I am an aspiring software developer situated in Vancouver, British Columbia. I have a Bachelor's Degree
                in Electrical Engineering, obtained from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2018.<br>
                I also have over two years of experience working as an control systems & instrumentation engineer in
                the engineering consulting and manufacturing industries. <br>
                Aside from my work related experience, I also enjoy hobbiess such as fishing, hiking, working out,
                algorithmic trading, taking a long walk in nature, as well as backpacking to cool parts of the world! As
                of now, I have travelled to more than 20 countries across the world and I plan to backpack across South
                America in the near future!
