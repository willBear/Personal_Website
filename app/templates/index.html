          <h2>About Me </h2>
            <div>
                I am an aspiring software developer situated in Vancouver, British Columbia. I have a Bachelor's Degree
                in Electrical Engineering, obtained from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2018.<br><br>
                I also have over two years of experience working as an control systems & instrumentation engineer in
                the engineering consulting and manufacturing industries. Over the course of my work experience, I had
                worked on numerous multi-million capital expansion projects, and developed a good understanding of software
                design concepts. My most noted project is still being used in the 10th largest sawmill in North America,
                and it is showcased on the companies website. I believe my experience working as an engineer combined
                with my programming knowledge will be a great asset for my future workplace.

                Aside from my work related experience, I also enjoy hobbies such as fishing, hiking, working out,
                algorithmic trading, watching disney movies, taking a long walk in nature, as well as backpacking to
                cool parts of the world! As of now, I have travelled to more than 20 countries across the world and I
                plan to backpack across South America in the near future!
