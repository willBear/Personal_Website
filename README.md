### Things to Improve
If you have the chance, here are several things that I have in mind to improve the current website
 - Navbar compatible with mobile device (collapsible)
 - Favicon addition (I couldn't figure this one out :p) 
 - SQLite Integration with Projects - Each project shows a unique page built and pulls information from database
